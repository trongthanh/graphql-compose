# Requirements

###Mongoose
Currently this package only supports [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) throu this [plugin](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose-mongoose). That means in order to generate GraphQL schemas from a database table class you shoud use Mongoose. There is a way to manually create the schema, but it would make more sence if you created it out of graphql only :)

###GraphQL
To use this package it would be a good idea to know the basics and the functions of [GraphQl](http://graphql.org/), and how the [Type System](http://graphql.org/docs/api-reference-type-system/) works. Since you are going to generate, edit and use this system you should start out there first.

###Relay
If you are going to use [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) with [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), it is a good idea to also know the basics of Relay, how it works and what the extra features in relay are. You can find theyr specification [here](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-relay-specification.html#content)
